# Nodejs_RestAPI
The code files listed will take care of the register and login part of the clients in terms of backend, it also includes the swigger documentation which will be given to the frontend web developer for their reference.

The swigger documentation will give all the details about our Rest API to the frontend developer

My Rest API Description:

Here i have created an index.js will be listening for the requests from the clients, 
whenever it finds a request, it tries to reach its appropriate end point(route).If its corresponding end point is not found it will give an error.

Once the client request finds its end point.Then it will pass the data that, it received from client to the controller section where a proper validation of the client can be done according to our requirement.If validations part is successful then it will forward the data to the service section otherwise it will give error to the user.

In the service section the actual business logic is applied and if all goes well then it will return a response to the client with a proper status codes and data.

Also in service section we can connect to the database where we can store all the data about our clients and later will be able to process it according to the user need.
